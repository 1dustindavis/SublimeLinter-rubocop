SublimeLinter-rubocop 2.0.1
----------------------------
- add new config option `use_bundle_exec` @smanolloff
- I'm looking for a new maintainer. The maintenance cost has been pretty low but I'm no longer using sublime or ruby in a day to day capacity. If you're interested speak up! https://github.com/SublimeLinter/SublimeLinter-rubocop/issues/38
